Dataset Description 

This dataset contains only MNI‐normalized BOLDs from fMRIPrep.

Participants: 54 meditation-trained participants (27 per group) scanned ≤ 2 weeks post-training

Scanning Site & Hardware: Center for Functional and Molecular Imaging (Georgetown University) using a 3 T Siemens TIM Trio with a 12-channel phased-array head coil.

Acquisition Parameters: Structural (T1 MP-RAGE): 176 slices, 1 mm isotropic voxels; TR = 1,900 ms; TE = 2.52 ms; matrix = 256 × 256; FoV = 250 mm; Functional (T2 EPI):* 46 transversal slices, 3 mm isotropic voxels; TR = 2,500 ms; TE = 30 ms; matrix = 64 × 64; FoV = 192 mm.

Task Structure: Two counter-balanced runs—Experience (Self) and Observe (Other) —each with 30 trials (15 fear-anticipation, 15 pain-experience); Audio cues (distinct beeps/buzzes) signal whether the participant or a study partner may/will receive pressure-pain; Before scanning, each participant briefly meets a stranger “partner,” told to be seated next door and visible via live video during the scan to enhance empathic engagement; Computer-controlled pneumatic device applies pressure (2.5–125 PSI, capped at 80 PSI for safety) to the lunula of the right thumbnail via a 1 cm² plastic probe; Device sits outside the magnet; pressure delivered through a flexible tube to a piston fixed on the participant’s (or partner’s) thumbnail; Pre-scan calibration ensures each participant experiences a matched “moderately painful” intensity.

- 30 trials
    - 30 cues (15 neutral, 15 pain)
    - 30 anticipation (15 neutral, 15 pain)
    - 30 stimulation (10 pain, 20 no pain)
    - 30 rest (10 pain, 20 no pain)

- 1 trial = 24 seconds
    - 3 s auditory signal for anticipation or safety
    - 3-12 s anticipation
    - 6 s pain stimulation
    - 3-12 rest 

- full trial and experiment
    - 15 s (anticipation + rest) + 9 (cue + stimulation) —> 24 s (full trial length) 
    - task time is 720 s

- Acquisition time is 750 s 
    - subtracted 10 s (4 volumes) from imaging data, events, and confounds

Preprint: Loneliness predicts reduced self-reported empathy but not empathic multi-voxel neural response patterns after meditation training
